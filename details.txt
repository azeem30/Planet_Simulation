The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun. Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. The Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth. The sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter., Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus has a thick toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat that causes a runaway greenhouse effect., Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun., Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system. It's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer with a thicker atmosphere billions of years ago., The Sun is the only star in our solar system. Its gravity holds our solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around the Sun. Nothing could live on the Sun but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.
