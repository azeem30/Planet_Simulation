Our solar system consists of one star, the Sun, and eight planets.
The eight planets in order from the Sun are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
The four planets closest to the Sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are known as the inner planets, while the four farthest planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are known as the outer planets.
Pluto was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system, but it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter, which is also the fifth planet from the Sun.
The smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury, which is also the closest planet to the Sun.
The asteroid belt is a region between the inner and outer planets where many small rocky bodies called asteroids are located.
The Kuiper Belt is a region beyond Neptune where many small icy bodies, including Pluto, are located.
The Oort Cloud is a hypothesized spherical cloud of icy objects that may exist at the outermost edges of the solar system.
The Sun makes up about 99.86% of the total mass of our solar system.
The four inner planets are made mostly of rock and metal, while the outer planets are mostly made of gas and ice.
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are often referred to as the gas giants because of their composition.
Earth is the only planet known to support life.
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.
Mars has the largest volcano and the deepest canyon in our solar system.
Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for centuries.
Saturn has the most extensive ring system of any planet in our solar system.
Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as the ice giants because of their composition.
The solar wind is a stream of charged particles that flows out from the Sun and interacts with the planets and other objects in the solar system.
The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft were launched in 1977 and have traveled beyond the edge of our solar system, providing valuable data about the outer planets and the interstellar medium.
